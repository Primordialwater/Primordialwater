For the above: if you wish for more information on what 'sensitive subjects' entails, you click on the text, it has been hidden intentionally so as to not force others to be uncomfortable by reading the text.

This also goes for those who tolerate the above sensitive subjects, by that I mean, if you could stop those sensitive subjects, or lessen them, you would still choose not to and allow them to continue. 

> Thin ice.

People who assume the worst of others without knowing the person or how they act.

People who treat their assumptions as fact, people who then use that assumption to make a statement about the person.

Note: An assumption is something WITHOUT any evidence to back it up that is treated as a fact, or certain.

> About me.

 I like cookie run: kingdom and Genshin Impact.

 I may be blunt at times, or dry. However, I am not devoid of warmth, as I am friendly and I will likely joke around with you.

 If you upset me, I will tell you, only if we're friends or acquaintances.

 I have autism, so let that explain the reason why I may act the way I sometimes do, of course, if I do something wrong, do not use this as a way to justify my actions.

 If I do end up doing something wrong, explain it to me (calmly, emotional language may blind me and make me feel threatened, that is not a good response), and I will not do it again.

> Some things I find important to note.

If someone disrespects your boundaries, even after being reminded time and time again of such, you have the right to leave, do not stay there and suffer, please.

PLEASE stay safe. If you suspect yourself to be in danger, do not be afraid to call your local emergency services. You should also try to remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible.

If you suspect yourself to be in a dangerous relationship but are not sure, please talk about why you feel this way with a trusted individual, perferably someone who doesn't know the person you will be talking about all too well, as that could lead to bias, or a skewed perception of events, it is good to get another's opinion on something. If they agree with you on the person being dangerous, please get out of that relationship. Do not go to talk to the person alone, please make sure to prioritize your safety by telling other trusted individuals about your plan to talk to the person, if needed, you can bring them along if needed, talk to the person in a public space, as doing so will lower chances of violence. Remain direct and resepectful, you can practice what you are going to say if possible, do not forget to stand your ground if they try to twist your words. Refuse any contact after leaving the relationship. Please also consider seeking professional mental health support, remember that you did not, or do not, deserve to suffer through any abuse.

Note: I feel it to be important to add: I do not just mean a romantic relationship, I also mean platonic relationships, like friends or family, when I speak of relationships.

Note for source : the preposition 'Ex' is not strictly only used for romantic relationships, though I know it to be used commonly in those ways.. I just felt it important to note that.

If you need help, please try to find out the hotline specific for your area that will help you go through whatever you're going through, you don't need to suffer alone, you are human, you too need a shoulder you can lean on, please never forget that.
