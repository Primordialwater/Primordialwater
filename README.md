..I'll look into it.

> About me.

 I like cookie run: kingdom and Genshin Impact.

 I may be blunt at times, or dry. However, I am not devoid of warmth, as I am friendly and I will likely joke around with you.

 If you upset me, I will tell you, only if we're friends or acquaintances.

 I have autism, so let that explain the reason why I may act the way I sometimes do, of course, if I do something wrong, do not use this (my autism) as a way to justify my actions.

 If I do end up doing something wrong, explain it to me (calmly, emotional language may blind me and make me feel threatened, that is not a good response), and I will not do it again.

 I purposefully misspell words when talking to others sometimes (ex. like becomes liek), if you cannot read my text because of this and I'm hanging out with, talking to, or in a conversation with you, you can tell me, and do it nicely, please!

> Some things I find important to note.

If someone disrespects your boundaries, even after being reminded time and time again of such, you have the right to leave, do not stay there and suffer, please.

PLEASE stay safe. If you suspect yourself to be in danger, do not be afraid to call your local emergency services. You should also try to remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible.

If you suspect yourself to be in a dangerous relationship but are not sure, please talk about why you feel this way with a trusted individual, perferably someone who doesn't know the person you will be talking about all too well, as that could lead to bias, or a skewed perception of events, it is good to get another's opinion on something. If they agree with you on the person being dangerous, please get out of that relationship. Do not go to talk to the person alone, please make sure to prioritize your safety by telling other trusted individuals about your plan to talk to the person, if needed, you can bring them along, talk to the person in a public space, as doing so will lower the chances of any possible violence. Remain direct and resepectful, you can practice what you are going to say if that'll help, do not forget to stand your ground if they try to twist your words or manipulate you. Refuse any contact after leaving the relationship. Please also consider seeking professional mental health support, remember that you did not, or do not, deserve to suffer through any abuse. You are strong, never forget that.

Note: I feel it to be important to add that when I speak of relationships, I do not just mean a romantic relationship, I also mean platonic relationships, like friends or family.

Note for source : the preposition 'Ex' is not strictly only used for romantic relationships, though I know it to be used commonly in those ways.. I just felt it important to note that.

If you, or someone you know, needs help, please try to find out the hotline specific for your area that will help you, or the other person, go through whatever you're going through. No one needs to suffer alone, we are human, we need a shoulder we can lean on, so please, never forget that.

> Thank you for reading, I appreciate it.

..Can we rest now?
